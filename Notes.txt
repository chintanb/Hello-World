# The most popular javascript library on the planet. 

# Put a jquery 1.10.1. js at the end of body tag, as all will be done and at last the java script will be downloaded so it wil be more efficient. 
# So, all the css and html elements will be loaded before the java script so a website will appear to be loaded quickly .

$('ul li').addClass('emphasis') ; is identical to 
jQuery('ul li').addClass('emphasis') ;


# Here we are loading the file from the server. So a user needs to redownload the code everytime he runs an application. Instead we can get a link of the google CDN, so instead of src="jquery-1.10.1.js" we can place  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.0/jquery.min.js"></script> 
Beware, if we dnt have n internet connection, it will not run. But for a production purpose its a good idea. 

# // $('li:first-child').addClass('emphasis') ;
It will select the first child of its parent which <ul> in this case. 

# IMP : Here, if we put the aforementioned snippet in <head> (i.e. Embedding it in the html itself), then it wont be applied. Because, this tries to work with the DOM, before it gets loaded. This will tell that hey JQeury, find a first child of the parent of li, but wait a minute, we havent discovered it yet. 
Thats the reaseon why document.ready(function(){}); comes to the picture. That will wait until the DOM gets ready to be manipulated. 

# We can create function in two ways. First is an anonymous function, that is frequent. 
Second one gets cleared from the example. 

var functionName = function(){
}; 
$(document).ready(functionName);(

# Instead of document.ready we can simple use, 
$(function(){
		// write anything as if you are writing in document.ready's function. Means the same. 
});

# This edit is for the test of Github editing. Lets see now where it gets reflected.
