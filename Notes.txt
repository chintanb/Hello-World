# The most popular javascript library on the planet. 

# Put a jquery 1.10.1. js at the end of body tag, as all will be done and at last the java script will be downloaded so it wil be more efficient. 
# So, all the css and html elements will be loaded before the java script so a website will appear to be loaded quickly .

$('ul li').addClass('emphasis') ; is identical to 
jQuery('ul li').addClass('emphasis') ;


# Here we are loading the file from the server. So a user needs to redownload the code everytime he runs an application. Instead we can get a link of the google CDN, so instead of src="jquery-1.10.1.js" we can place  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.0/jquery.min.js"></script> 
Beware, if we dnt have n internet connection, it will not run. But for a production purpose its a good idea.
